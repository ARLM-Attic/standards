Title: Acronyms and Abbreviations
---

Acronyms are one of those things that can have inconsistent formatting. Ideally, each language provides rules for how to handle them, but in the abscence of those rules, the following is used for Pascal and Camel Case conventions:

* Two character acronyms are kept as capital letters (e.g., DB and IO).
* Three or more character acronyms have an initial capital (e.g., Xml, Scuba).

Abbreviations are slightly different. In all cases, an abbreviation has an initial capital and the rest is lowercase, even for two-character abbreviations. For example, the ID field is written as "Id".
